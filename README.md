I wasn't sure exactly how to submit this to make it easy to test. The services are in app.py, and the react code is in App.js.
The only other key file is the App.css for the react application.

You will need to re-create the Python ENV with Python3 or have it installed otherwise.

To run web services, 
$ Python3 app.py

To run website,
$ cd (to React project)
$ npm install  (to recreate the node_module contents)
$ npm start

Set browser to url: /localhost:3000
(package.json will proxy to 5000 for the Flask services)
