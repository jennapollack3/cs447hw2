I wasn't sure exactly how to submit this to make it easy to test. The services are in app.py, and the react code is in App.js.
The only other key file is the App.css for the react application.

To run web services, 
$ Python3 app.py

To run website,
$ cd (to React project)
$ npm start

Set browser to url: /localhost:3000
(package.json will proxy to 5000 for the Flask services)
